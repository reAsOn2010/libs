h2. Realized 

* Stack (roughly tested)
* Binary Search Trees (tested)
* Min-heap (tested)
* Leftist Heap (roughly tested) (recursive)(iterative) (lazy_del related functions need test) (lazy_del function need parameter of pointer,but I haven't accomplished the function to get a node's position)
* AVL Trees (tested)
* Red Black Trees(insert and delete completed, need comments and finishing)

h2. Not yet
